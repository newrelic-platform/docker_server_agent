#
# Sample Dockerfile for the New Relic Linux Server Monitor. This is intended
# to be used from the extracted tar file directory of a given LSM release.
# Therefore, it is extremely simple as it does not need to download anything.
#
# All configuration is handled by environment variables, and requires at least
# version 2.1.0.117 or later of the LSM agent, which is when the -E flag and
# support for environment variables was added.
